# Tiny repo to list vds sites from couchdb, postgres

I am resisting bloating up impute_missing repo by putting this here.

The goal is to write some small, tested code that loads vds sites.

It should load vds sites that need imputing for a given year

It should load vds sites that need graphics processing for a given
year

It should load up vds sites that need truck imputation
